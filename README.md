# mushroom_classification
This repo represents the final project for CS 82B that I took through Santa Monica College (SMC).

In this project, I utilize the mushroom dataset found on UCI's Machine Learning Repository.

Please find attached the Jupyter Notebook which is slightly less annotated than one which I would normally submit as a project. That is because I also wrote a report for this project which you can find attached. The parameters for the report were outlined by our professor and are not necessarily what I might write independently when writing up a report on a machine learning project. Regardless, the information is there now.
